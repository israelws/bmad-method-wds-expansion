# Button — Functional Component Reference

**Example functional component referenced from the WDS course**

---

## Coming Soon

This is a reference component specification linked from [Module 12: Functional Components](../../docs/learn/module-12-functional-components/tutorial-12.md). In a real WDS project, this file would contain the complete functional component specification for the Button component, including all variants, states, and usage guidelines.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | Button |
| **Type** | Functional Component |
| **Location** | C-UX-Scenarios/Functional-Components/ |

## Purpose

Functional component specifications live in the project's `C-UX-Scenarios/Functional-Components/` folder. Page specifications reference these components instead of re-defining shared behavior inline.

This separation means:
- Components are defined once, used everywhere
- Changes propagate automatically
- Page specs stay focused on what's unique to that page
