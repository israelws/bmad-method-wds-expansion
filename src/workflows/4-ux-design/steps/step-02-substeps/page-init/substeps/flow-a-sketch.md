# Flow A: Sketch Path

**Activates when:** User chooses to draw a sketch (physical/digital)

---

## Process

<output>**Perfect! Let's set up for your sketch.**

I'll create:
1. Page placeholder with navigation
2. Sketches folder ready for upload
3. Basic page structure

When you're ready, upload your sketch and we'll analyze it together using the Page Process Workshop.</output>

---

## Actions

1. Run `page-init-lightweight.md` to create structure
2. User uploads sketch when ready
3. Return to `workshop-page-process.md` for analysis

---

**This is the preferred path - sketches capture design intent best.**
