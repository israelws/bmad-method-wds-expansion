## Key Principles

### ✅ **Navigation is Critical**
- Appears three times (above sketch, below sketch, document bottom)
- Links to previous/next pages
- Creates navigable flow
- Essential for comprehension

### ✅ **Open Questions Ready**
- Section included from start
- Reference `open-questions.instructions.md` during spec creation
- Auto-populate based on page characteristics
- Ensures no edge cases are missed
