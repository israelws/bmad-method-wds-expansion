# Step 8.1: Identify Opportunity

## Your Task

Identify the strategic challenge or improvement opportunity you'll address in this Kaizen cycle.

---

## Two Contexts

This step works differently depending on your context:

### Context A: Existing Product Entry Point

You're joining an existing product to solve a strategic challenge

### Context B: Continuous Improvement (Post-Launch)

You're iterating on a live product based on data and feedback

---

## Context A: Existing Product Entry Point

### You're Brought In to Solve a Problem

**Typical scenarios:**

- Product has a critical UX issue (high drop-off, low engagement)
- New feature needs expert design
- Product needs strategic improvement
- Team needs a linchpin designer

---

### Understand the Strategic Challenge

**Ask these questions:**

1. **What's the problem?** - What specific issue, what's broken, what metrics show it?
2. **Why now?** - Why priority, business impact, what if we don't fix?
3. **What's the scope?** - Which screens/features, what can we change?
4. **What's success?** - How to measure, target metric, when?

---

### Document the Challenge

**Create:** `A-Project-Brief/limited-brief.md`

**See:** [substeps/context-templates.md](substeps/context-templates.md) for Limited Project Brief template

---

## Context B: Continuous Improvement (Post-Launch)

### Your Product is Live

You're monitoring performance and iterating based on data.

---

### Monitor Product Performance

**Gather data from multiple sources:**

#### 1. Analytics

Check key metrics:
- User engagement (DAU, WAU, MAU)
- Feature usage (which features are used?)
- Drop-off points (where do users leave?)
- Conversion rates (are users completing goals?)

#### 2. User Feedback

Review feedback channels:
- Support tickets
- App store reviews
- In-app feedback
- User interviews

#### 3. Team Insights

Talk to your team:
- What are developers noticing?
- What are support seeing?
- What are stakeholders concerned about?

---

### Identify Improvement Opportunity

**Use the Kaizen prioritization framework:**

### Priority = Impact × Effort × Learning

| Factor | High | Medium | Low |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| **Impact** | Solves major pain | Improves experience | Nice to have |
| **Effort** | 1-2 days | 3-5 days | 1-2 weeks |
| **Learning** | Tests hypothesis | Validates assumption | Incremental |

---

### Document the Opportunity

**Create:** `improvements/IMP-XXX-description.md`

**See:** [substeps/context-templates.md](substeps/context-templates.md) for Improvement Opportunity template

---

## Next Step

After identifying the opportunity:

```
[C] Continue to step-8.2-gather-context.md
```

---

## Success Metrics

✅ Strategic challenge or opportunity identified
✅ Problem clearly defined
✅ Impact quantified
✅ Scope defined
✅ Success criteria established
✅ Documented in limited brief or improvement file

---

## Failure Modes

❌ Vague problem definition
❌ No data to support priority
❌ Scope too large (not Kaizen)
❌ No success metrics
❌ Not understanding root cause

---

## Tips

### DO ✅

**Be specific:** Quantify the problem, use real data, define clear scope

**Be strategic:** Focus on high-impact changes, small incremental improvements

**Be data-driven:** Use analytics, listen to user feedback, test hypotheses

### DON'T ❌

**Don't be vague:** "Make it better" ❌ → "40% drop-off at onboarding" ✅

**Don't boil the ocean:** Complete redesign ❌ → Targeted improvement ✅

---

**Remember:** Kaizen is about small, strategic improvements that compound over time!
