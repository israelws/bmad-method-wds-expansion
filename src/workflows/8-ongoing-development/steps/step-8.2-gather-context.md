# Step 8.2: Gather Context

## Your Task

Understand the existing product context before making changes.

---

## Before You Start

**Ensure you have:**

- ✅ Completed step 8.1 (opportunity identified)
- ✅ Limited brief or improvement file created
- ✅ Clear understanding of the problem

---

## Context A: Existing Product Entry Point

### Gather Existing Materials

**You're joining an existing product. Collect everything:**

| Category | Upload To | Review For |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Business** | `A-Project-Brief/existing-context/business/` | Why product exists, business model, competitors |
| **Users** | `A-Project-Brief/existing-context/users/` | Who are users, needs, pain points |
| **Product** | `A-Project-Brief/existing-context/product/` | Features, tech stack, constraints |

---

### Use the Product

**Critical: Experience it yourself!**

1. Download/access the product
2. Create an account, go through onboarding
3. Use all major features
4. Document your experience

**See:** [substeps/context-templates.md](substeps/context-templates.md) for First Impressions template

---

### Create Focused Trigger Map

**Based on your strategic challenge:**

**File:** `B-Trigger-Map/focused-trigger-map.md`

**See:** [substeps/context-templates.md](substeps/context-templates.md) for Focused Trigger Map template

---

## Context B: Continuous Improvement

### You Already Know the Product

**You designed it! But gather fresh data:**

### 1. Analytics Deep Dive

Focus on the specific feature/flow you're improving.

**See:** [substeps/context-templates.md](substeps/context-templates.md) for Analytics template

### 2. User Feedback Analysis

Categorize feedback about this specific feature.

**See:** [substeps/context-templates.md](substeps/context-templates.md) for User Feedback template

### 3. Review Original Design Intent

Why did you design it this way? What assumptions did you make?

### 4. Competitive Analysis

How do competitors handle this? What can we learn?

---

## Synthesis

**Combine all context into actionable insights:**

**See:** [substeps/context-templates.md](substeps/context-templates.md) for Context Synthesis template

Key elements:
- What we know (key insights)
- Root cause (why is this happening)
- Hypothesis (what will solve it)
- Validation plan (how will we know)

---

## Next Step

After gathering context:

```
[C] Continue to step-8.3-design-update.md
```

---

## Success Metrics

✅ All existing materials gathered
✅ Product experienced firsthand
✅ Focused trigger map created (if new entry)
✅ Analytics analyzed (if continuous improvement)
✅ User feedback categorized
✅ Root cause identified
✅ Hypothesis formed

---

## Failure Modes

❌ Not using the product yourself
❌ Relying only on documentation
❌ Ignoring user feedback
❌ Not identifying root cause
❌ Jumping to solutions too quickly

**Remember:** Understanding context deeply leads to better solutions!
