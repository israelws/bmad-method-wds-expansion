# Step 8.8: Iterate (Kaizen Never Stops)

## Your Task

Use learnings from this cycle to identify and start the next improvement.

---

## Before You Start

**Ensure you have:**

- ✅ Completed step 8.7 (impact measured)
- ✅ Impact report created
- ✅ Learnings documented
- ✅ Results shared with team

---

## The Kaizen Philosophy

**改善 (Kaizen) = Continuous Improvement**

```
Ship → Monitor → Learn → Improve → Ship → Monitor → Learn...
                            ↑
                       You are here!
```

**This cycle never stops!**

**See:** [substeps/kaizen-principles.md](substeps/kaizen-principles.md) for Kaizen vs Kaikaku and core principles

---

## Review Your Learnings

### From Impact Report

**See:** [substeps/monitoring-templates.md](substeps/monitoring-templates.md) for Learnings Documentation template

Key questions:
- What worked?
- What didn't work?
- What patterns are emerging?
- What hypotheses were validated/rejected?
- What new questions arose?

---

## Identify Next Opportunity

**Three sources for next improvement:**

### 1. Iterate on Current Update

If the update was partially successful - refine it.

**See:** [substeps/monitoring-templates.md](substeps/monitoring-templates.md) for "Iterate on Current Update" template

### 2. Apply Pattern to Similar Feature

If the update was successful - apply the pattern elsewhere.

**See:** [substeps/monitoring-templates.md](substeps/monitoring-templates.md) for "Apply Pattern" template

### 3. Address New Problem

From monitoring and feedback - tackle new issues.

**See:** [substeps/monitoring-templates.md](substeps/monitoring-templates.md) for "New Problem" template

---

## Prioritize Next Cycle

**Use Kaizen prioritization:**

### Priority = Impact × Effort × Learning

**See:** [substeps/monitoring-templates.md](substeps/monitoring-templates.md) for Kaizen Prioritization template

---

## Start Next Cycle

**Return to Step 8.1 with your next opportunity:**

```
[K] Return to step-8.1-identify-opportunity.md
```

**See:** [substeps/monitoring-templates.md](substeps/monitoring-templates.md) for Kaizen Cycle Log template

---

## Completion

**Phase 8 is complete when:**

- ✅ Improvement identified
- ✅ Context gathered
- ✅ Update designed
- ✅ Delivery created
- ✅ Handed off to BMad
- ✅ Implementation validated
- ✅ Impact measured
- ✅ Next cycle started

**But Phase 8 never truly ends - Kaizen is continuous!**

---

## Next Steps

**You have two paths:**

### Path A: Continue Kaizen Cycle

```
[K] Return to step-8.1-identify-opportunity.md
    Start next improvement cycle
```

### Path B: New Product Feature

```
[N] Return to Phase 4-5 (UX Design & Design System)
    Design new complete user flow
    Then Phase 6 (Design Deliveries)
```

---

## When to Pause Kaizen

**Kaizen never stops, but you might pause for:**

- Major strategic shift (new product direction, pivot)
- Team capacity (overwhelmed, need to stabilize)
- Measurement period (waiting for data)

**But always return to Kaizen!**

---

## Success Metrics

✅ Learnings reviewed
✅ Next opportunity identified
✅ Prioritization complete
✅ Next cycle started
✅ Cycle log updated

---

## Failure Modes

❌ Not reviewing learnings
❌ Not identifying next opportunity
❌ Stopping after one cycle
❌ Not prioritizing effectively
❌ Scope creep (turning Kaizen into Kaikaku)

---

**Remember:** Great products aren't built in one big redesign. They're built through continuous, disciplined improvement. One cycle at a time. Forever. 改善
